        <p>My recommendations for accessibility on this website would mainly include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Going with a consistent color on the footer. Either darkening the blue so that the white text comes through for readability, or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Since I ues Firefox, the page needed to be loaded in Chrome to be viewed properly. I would do the CSS steps to clear out browser-CSS and build the site so it is similar on all browsers from there.</li>
        </ol>
